# welcometolabview
This is a digital version of the board game Welcome To Your Perfect Home written in LabView https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/233867/welcome. I do not own the copywrite to the game itself. If you want to play this game, I strongly suggest buying the game from the publisher or from a local board game store https://www.deepwatergaming.com/collections/best-sellers/products/welcome-to. You can also now play this game on Board Game Arena https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=welcometo.

This LabView version was written before this game was available to be played online when the pandemic started in 2020. I wanted to play with friends over video calls, and pointing my phone at my table didn't seem as practical as coding the game and sharing my screen.

This project has a few dependencies, including the OpenG toolkit.
