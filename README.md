# welcometolabview
This is a digital version of the board game Welcome To Your Perfect Home written in LabView https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/233867/welcome.

There is a compiled version in the folder /builds/ that requires the LabView 2019 runtime engine. There is also an installer in the folder /builds/ which will install the LabView 2019 runtime engine and the .exe for the game. If you trust the .exe files in this project, that is.

I do not own the copywrite to the game itself. If you want to play this game, I strongly suggest buying the game from the publisher or from a local board game store https://www.deepwatergaming.com/collections/best-sellers/products/welcome-to. You can also now play this game on Board Game Arena https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=welcometo. I have provided copywrite-free assets to be included with this code, though I did use assets from the actual game when playing with friends.

This LabView version was written before this game was available to be played online when the pandemic started in 2020. I wanted to play with friends over video calls, and pointing my phone at my table didn't seem as practical as coding the game and sharing my screen.

This project has a few dependencies, including the OpenG toolkit. (I wish LabView had a better tool for flagging dependent packages.)
This project was written in LabView 2019.
